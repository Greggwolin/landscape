## 📝 Technical Debt Tracking

### Database Schema
- [x] **NEW**: Land use taxonomy tables created (`landscape.lu_family`, `landscape.lu_subtype`, `landscape.tbl_landuse`)
- [x] **NEW**: Database seed system operational for automated schema setup
- [x] **NEW**: Foreign key relationships established between families, subtypes, and land uses
- [ ] **Performance**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- [ ] **Data**: Normalize jurisdiction data (currently strings)
- [ ] **Constraints**: Add additional foreign key constraints for data integrity

### Code Quality  
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit tests coverage currently at ~20%
- [ ] **TypeScript**: Some components still have `any` types
- [ ] **Performance**: Several components re-render unnecessarily
- [ ] **Security**: API endpoints need rate limiting

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Deployment**: No CI/CD pipeline yet
- [ ] **Monitoring**: No error tracking or analytics
- [ ] **Backup**: No automated database backups
- [ ] **Security**: No security headers configured

## 🐛 Known Bugs

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
- None currently identified

### Major (Fix This Sprint)
- [ ] **Land Use**: Page crashes if project has no jurisdiction data
- [ ] **Home**: Edit mode doesn't work if project selector is empty

### Minor (Fix When Convenient)  
- [ ] **General**: Console warnings about React keys in some lists
- [ ] **Styling**: Inconsistent focus ring colors across components
- [ ] **Data**: Some dropdowns show undefined options briefly on load

## 🗒️ Session Activity Log

| Timestamp | Summary |
|-----------|---------|
| 2025-09-23 11:38 MST | **Neon Database Integration Complete**: Connected all planning page APIs to Neon database. Fixed "wrong land use families list" issue by updating families API to query `landscape.lu_family` table instead of hardcoded data. Ran database seed to create proper land use taxonomy structure (families, subtypes, products). Planning system now fully database-driven with 9 real families vs previous 4 hardcoded. All parcel CRUD operations confirmed working with live database. |
| 2025-09-20 23:58 MST | Planning tile system refinements: fixed duplicate phase labels, implemented responsive tile layout with proper text wrapping, resolved editing tile expansion using col-span-2 approach, enhanced family code display logic, and resolved multiple text bleeding and layout issues for improved UX in the planning module. |
| 2025-09-20 14:03 MST | Planning module refinements pending git sync: wired parcel Product dropdown to live DVL data sources, tightened inline tile layout with compact controls, enforced inline input contrast, introduced top-level status navigation, and scaffolded the development status activity log. |

> Detailed diffs for this session are available inline on the Development Status dashboard (Session Activity Log section).
