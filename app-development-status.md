## Latest Updates

### Planning Interface Inline Editing Implementation (September 16, 2025)

#### Summary
Successfully implemented a complete inline editing system for the Planning interface, allowing direct editing of Areas, Phases, and Parcels without navigation to separate pages or modal dialogs.

#### Key Features Implemented

**1. Inline Area Editing**
- Direct click-to-edit for area names and descriptions
- Transparent input fields that blend with tile backgrounds
- Save/Cancel functionality with keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape)

**2. Inline Phase Editing**
- Direct click-to-edit for phase names and descriptions
- Same transparent input styling for consistent UX
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick save/cancel

**3. Inline Parcel Editing with Cascading DVL System**
- **Development Value List (DVL)** cascading dropdowns:
  - Family → Subtype → Product selection
  - Proper API filtering for each level
  - Dynamic loading based on selections
- Editable fields:
  - Parcel name
  - Land use family selection
  - Subtype selection (filtered by family)
  - Product selection (filtered by subtype)
  - Acres (numeric input)
  - Units (numeric input)
- Compact form design suitable for small parcel tiles

#### Technical Implementation

**Frontend Changes:**
- Created `PlanningWizardInline.tsx` as main container
- Created `ProjectCanvasInline.tsx` for Project view inline editing
- Created `PhaseCanvasInline.tsx` for Phase view inline editing
- Updated navigation to replace "Planning" with "Planning (Inline)"
- Moved original Planning to Settings as "Planning (Legacy)"

**Backend API Enhancements:**
- Enhanced `/api/landuse/subtypes` to support `family_id` filtering
- Enhanced `/api/landuse/products` to support `subtype_id` filtering
- Implemented backward compatibility for existing components
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Database Integration:**
- Fixed SQL data type casting issues (`family_id::text`)
- Resolved missing column references (created_at, updated_at)
- Proper JOIN relationships between families, subtypes, and products

#### Issues Resolved

**1. React Key Warnings**
- Added proper key props with fallbacks: `key={family.family_id || family.family_name || index}`

**2. State Management Issues**
- Fixed variable naming mismatches (`editingParcelData` vs `parcelEditValues`)
- Corrected function signatures and parameter passing
- Resolved state synchronization between form fields and API calls

**3. API Filtering Problems**
- Debugged SQL query failures due to missing columns
- Fixed data type casting for proper family_id filtering
- Implemented proper error handling and fallback queries

**4. Caching and Compilation Issues**
- Resolved Next.js Turbopack caching problems
- Force-refreshed API endpoints to ensure code updates took effect
- Cleared .next cache for clean rebuilds

**5. Backward Compatibility**
- Ensured original PlanningWizard continues to work
- Implemented dual response formats (array vs object) based on query parameters
- Maintained existing functionality while adding new features

#### Data Verification
- **Total Subtypes in Database:** 32 across all families
- **Family Distribution:**
  - Residential (ID: 1): 9 subtypes
  - Commercial (ID: 2): 2 subtypes
  - Industrial (ID: 3): 3 subtypes
  - Common Areas (ID: 4): 5 subtypes
  - Public (ID: 5): 4 subtypes
  - Other (ID: 6): 3 subtypes
  - Institutional (ID: 8): 6 subtypes

#### User Experience Improvements
- **No Page Navigation:** All editing happens directly within tiles
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear edit states with outline indicators
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Cascading Logic:** Selecting family filters subtypes, selecting subtype filters products
- **Data Persistence:** All changes saved to database via PATCH APIs
- **Error Prevention:** Proper validation and error handling

#### Navigation Updates
- **Primary Planning:** Now uses inline editing interface
- **Legacy Planning:** Moved to Settings section for backward compatibility
- **Clean UX:** Removed "Manage Parcels" button that caused page navigation

#### Next Steps / Future Enhancements
- Consider adding undo/redo functionality
- Implement bulk edit capabilities for multiple parcels
- Add drag-and-drop for parcel reorganization
- Consider adding auto-save functionality
- Enhance mobile responsiveness for smaller screens
