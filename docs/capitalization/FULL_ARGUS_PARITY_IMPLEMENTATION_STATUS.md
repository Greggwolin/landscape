**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Session:** Continued from previous context
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Form Components), Phase 2 In Progress

---

## Overview

This document tracks the comprehensive integration of ALL database fields (88+ fields across 4 entities) into the Capitalization Tab UI to achieve full ARGUS parity.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: UI Form Components (COMPLETED)

### Created Comprehensive Modal Forms

All four modal form components have been created with complete field coverage:

1. **[DebtFacilityForm.tsx](../../src/app/prototypes/multifam/rent-roll-inputs/components/DebtFacilityForm.tsx)** - 34 fields
   - Basic Information (7 fields): facility_name, lender_name, loan_amount, interest_rate_pct, loan_term_years, amortization_years, is_construction_loan
   - Rate Structure (6 fields): rate_type, index_name, spread_over_index_bps, rate_floor_pct, rate_cap_pct, rate_reset_frequency
   - Underwriting Metrics (2 fields): ltv_pct, dscr
   - Fees & Prepayment (4 fields): commitment_fee_pct, extension_fee_bps, prepayment_penalty_years, exit_fee_pct
   - Guarantees (2 fields): guarantee_type, guarantor_name

### Form Component Features

- **Mode-Aware Visibility**: All forms respect basic/standard/advanced modes
- **Organized Sections**: Fields grouped logically with collapsible sections
- **Validation**: Required fields, split validation (waterfall), currency formatting
- **Professional UX**: Modal/drawer pattern, scrollable content, sticky headers/footers
- **Helpful UI**: Currency displays, percentage inputs, tooltips, examples

---

## ✅ Phase 2: TypeScript Interfaces (COMPLETED)

Updated all interfaces in [CapitalizationTab.tsx](../../src/app/prototypes/multifam/rent-roll-inputs/components/CapitalizationTab.tsx):

- `DebtFacility`: 7 → 34 fields
- `EquityTranche`: 7 → 28 fields
- `WaterfallTier`: 7 → 9 fields
- `DrawScheduleItem`: 5 → 17 fields

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Main Component Integration (IN PROGRESS)

### What Needs to Be Done

The main [CapitalizationTab.tsx](../../src/app/prototypes/multifam/rent-roll-inputs/components/CapitalizationTab.tsx) component needs significant refactoring:

1. **Import New Form Components**
   ```typescript
   import DebtFacilityForm from './DebtFacilityForm';
   import EquityPartnerForm from './EquityPartnerForm';
   import WaterfallTierForm from './WaterfallTierForm';
   import DrawScheduleForm from './DrawScheduleForm';
   ```

2. **Add State for Modal Management**
   ```typescript
   const [showDebtForm, setShowDebtForm] = useState(false);
   const [showEquityForm, setShowEquityForm] = useState(false);
   const [showWaterfallForm, setShowWaterfallForm] = useState(false);
   const [showDrawForm, setShowDrawForm] = useState(false);
   const [editingItem, setEditingItem] = useState<any | null>(null);
   ```

3. **Replace Inline Table Editing**
   - Remove all inline editing inputs from tables
   - Keep tables as read-only summary views with key fields
   - Add "View/Edit" buttons that open modal forms
   - Update "Add" buttons to open forms instead of inline rows

4. **Update CRUD Handlers**
   - Modify `saveDebtEdit`, `saveEquityEdit`, etc. to work with modal forms
   - Pass complete form data to API endpoints

5. **Simplify Table Display**
   - Show only 4-6 key fields per entity in table
   - Add expand/collapse for additional summary info
   - Keep tables lightweight and scannable

## 🔄 Phase 4: API Endpoint Updates (PENDING)

### GET Endpoints - Need to Return All Fields

Currently GET endpoints return limited fields. Need to update:

1. **[/api/capitalization/debt/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/debt/route.ts)**
   - Add all 34 fields to SELECT query
   - Update response transformation

2. **[/api/capitalization/equity/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/equity/route.ts)**
   - Add all 28 fields to SELECT query
   - Update response transformation

3. **[/api/capitalization/waterfall/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/waterfall/route.ts)**
   - Add all 9 fields to SELECT query

4. **[/api/capitalization/draws/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/draws/route.ts)**
   - Add all 17 fields to SELECT query

### PATCH Endpoints - Need to Handle All Fields

Currently PATCH endpoints handle 6-8 fields. Need to update field mappings:

1. **[/api/capitalization/debt/[facility_id]/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/debt/[facility_id]/route.ts)**
   - Expand `fieldMapping` object to include all 34 fields
   - Currently: 8 fields → Target: 34 fields

2. **[/api/capitalization/equity/[tranche_id]/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/equity/[tranche_id]/route.ts)**
   - Expand field mapping to all 28 fields
   - Currently: ~10 fields → Target: 28 fields

3. **[/api/capitalization/waterfall/[tier_id]/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/waterfall/[tier_id]/route.ts)**
   - Add missing 4 fields (currently has 6 of 9)

4. **[/api/capitalization/draws/[draw_id]/route.ts](../../src/app/api/capitalization/draws/[draw_id]/route.ts)**
   - Expand to all 17 fields (currently has 4)

### POST Endpoints - Need to Accept All Fields

Similar updates needed for creation endpoints.

## 📋 Phase 5: Testing & Validation (PENDING)

### Test Matrix

| Entity | Create | Read | Update | Delete |
|--------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| Debt Facility | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| Equity Partner | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| Waterfall Tier | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |
| Draw Schedule | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ | ⏳ |

### Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Mode**: Test with minimal required fields
2. **Standard Mode**: Test with common fields
3. **Advanced Mode**: Test with all fields including edge cases
4. **Validation**: Test required fields, split percentages, date ranges
5. **Data Persistence**: Verify all fields save and retrieve correctly

## 🎯 Field Coverage Summary

| Entity | Database Fields | UI Form Fields | GET Endpoint | PATCH Endpoint | Coverage |
|--------|----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Debt Facility | 34 | ✅ 34 | ⏳ ~12 | ⏳ 8 | Form: 100%, API: 35% |
| Equity Partner | 28 | ✅ 28 | ⏳ ~15 | ⏳ 10 | Form: 100%, API: 53% |
| Waterfall Tier | 9 | ✅ 9 | ⏳ 6 | ⏳ 6 | Form: 100%, API: 67% |
| Draw Schedule | 17 | ✅ 17 | ⏳ 5 | ⏳ 4 | Form: 100%, API: 29% |
| **TOTAL** | **88** | **88** | **~38** | **~28** | **Form: 100%, API: 43%** |

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Modal Forms vs Inline Editing?

With 34+ fields per entity, inline table editing becomes:
- **Unusable**: Too many columns, horizontal scrolling
- **Confusing**: Context switching between view/edit modes
- **Error-Prone**: Easy to accidentally edit wrong fields

Modal forms provide:
- **Organized Layout**: Grouped sections, clear hierarchy
- **Mode-Aware**: Progressive disclosure based on expertise level
- **Better UX**: Dedicated space, better validation, help text
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Scrollable, responsive design

### Field Organization

Fields are grouped by:
1. **Frequency of Use**: Most common fields in basic mode
2. **Complexity**: Advanced calculations in advanced mode
3. **Logical Grouping**: Related fields together (rates, fees, reserves)
4. **ARGUS Mapping**: Mirrors ARGUS property structure

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Dev Server Warnings**: Next.js 15 async params warnings in other routes (not capitalization)
2. **API Endpoint Errors**: Trying to edit debt facility currently fails (API not updated yet)
3. **Field Mappings**: Some API/DB field name mismatches need resolution

---

## 📊 Progress Metrics

- **Phase 1 (Form Components)**: 100% Complete
- **Phase 2 (Interfaces)**: 100% Complete
- **Phase 3 (Component Integration)**: 0% Complete
- **Phase 4 (API Updates)**: 0% Complete
- **Phase 5 (Testing)**: 0% Complete

**Overall Progress**: 40% Complete

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Integration is complete when:
1. ✅ All 88 fields have UI inputs
2. ⏳ All fields persist to database
3. ⏳ All fields display correctly on load
4. ⏳ Mode switching shows/hides appropriate fields
5. ⏳ Validation works for all required fields
6. ⏳ All CRUD operations work end-to-end

---

**Next Steps**: Update API endpoints to handle all fields, then integrate forms into main component.
