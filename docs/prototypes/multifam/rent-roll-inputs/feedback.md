need to consider landscaper workflow.  if user provides a detailed broker package that contains a complete rent roll, landscaper would populate the detailed rent roll and "roll up" those values into the floor plan matrix.  Alternatively, the document uploaded may contain ONLY the floorplan matrix.  Needs to work both ways.
